## Starting development work

Before writing code for a new task, create a fresh git worktree branched from the latest `origin/main`:

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add -b worktree-<name> .claude/worktrees/<name> origin/main
```

- Always branch from freshly fetched `origin/main` — never from the local checkout's HEAD, and never reuse an existing worktree or branch for new work.
- One worktree per task; convention is directory `.claude/worktrees/<name>` on branch `worktree-<name>`.
- The default branch is `main` (there is no `master`).
- `.claude/worktrees/` is gitignored; the rest of `.claude/` (skills, settings) is tracked.
